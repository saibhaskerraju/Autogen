This repo contains all possible ways of getting started tutorials on Autogen Library and running LLMs locally for free

## Run LLM models locally

I am using LM Studio, feel free to use whichever you feel is correct. Download [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/). Open the studio and search for models from UI. you can also search from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) website as well. On the left side of UI, look for ' <--> ' icon and start the server. thats it.
